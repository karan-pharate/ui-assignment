        No South state will accept Hindi imposition: Rajinikanth opposes Amit
        Shah's Hindi push
      </h1>
      <p>
        Superstar Rajinikanth has joined the chorus against Home Minister Amit
        Shah's recent push for Hindi as a unifying language for the country.
        After Kamal Haasan, now Rajinikanth has said that Tamil Nadu and other
        southern Indian states would never accept Hindi imposition.Speaking to
        reporters outside Chennai airport, Rajinikanth said, "Hindi language
        should not be imposed. Not just Tamil Nadu, none of the southern states
        will accept Hindi imposition." He added, "Not just Hindi, no language
        should be imposed on the country." Speaking to the media on Wednesday,
        Rajinikanth said, "If there is a common language it is good for the
        unity and progress of the country. Unfortunately it can't be implemented
        in our country. However, forcing a language is not acceptable. Southern
        states will not accept Hindi imposition. Even some northern states will
        not accept Hindi Imposition".
